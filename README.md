# EcoPack
Ecopack is a Native Application for Android whose's main objective is to facilitate the search for establishments that follow the best environmental practices in the food service industry. To achieve this, we have developed a map that includes customized markers indicating the type of packaging used by each establishment. Additionally, each registered establishment has a profile page where users can post comments and specify the type of packaging they encountered during their regular visits. The addition of stores is done by users themselves, with the user who creates a store being responsible for its maintenance. The application also includes a points system designed to encourage consumers and users to make more environmentally friendly choices when shopping by earning redeemable points at certain partner stores. Finally, a tracking system has been implemented to monitor each user’s weekly behavior through an interactive tree that changes based on activity over the last seven days. Moreover, there is an informational section covering various ecological topics relevant to the application's purpose and goals.
